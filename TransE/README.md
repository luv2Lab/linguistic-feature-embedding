This is an implementation of the TransE model by Kunxun Qi and Yuan Chen.
count_corr.py is used to get the correlation function, and it will generate a file called xxx_train2id.csv.
model_TransE_newLoss.py is the TransE model with new loss function by us.
model_TransE_oldLoss.py is the TransE model with the initial loss function

This project is the code to train TransE to get its project vector. 
You can copy the TransE_output to ../Syntatic_Dense_Embedding/TransE_output and run project_embedding_TransE.py for projecting feature.
