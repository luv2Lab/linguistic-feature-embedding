- GFE_TransE: to produce syntactic dense embeddings with TransE
  - run: Graph-based_feature_embedding_computation/project_embedding_TransE.py，
  - Results will be saved in: Graph-based_feature_embedding_computation/GFE/GFE_TransE 

- G-Doc: to produce document representation with Gaussian binning applied to linguistic feature vectors
  - In: Readability_Assessment/data/G_Doc

- Raw: original linguistic feature vectors
  - In: Readability_Assessment/data/Raw_data
